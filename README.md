## Installation

No installation required!
    
## Usage

When the user opens the page for the first time, they will be greated by a searchbar and five cards that represent the five phases of MCU movies.

If the user searches a movie in the searchbar, information about the movie will appear such as the director, the writers, actors, plot, etc.

If the user clicks a phase card, all movies associated with that phase are displayed, and if the user clicks on one of the movies, the same information about the movie will be displayed.

If the user really likes the movie that they are seeing information for, they can add it to their favorite's list. When they close the page and open it again, their favorites will be retained.

If the user clicks on a favorite from the list, information about that movie will be displayed similarly to the previous two uses.

If the user wanted to clear their favorites list, they can click the "clear favorites" button and all their favorites will be deleted and will not be shown again when the page is reloaded.
